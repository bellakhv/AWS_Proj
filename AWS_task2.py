I didn't had enough time to complete this task due to env issues.

If i had time I would write another script that uses the function ec2.monitor_instances(InstanceIds=['INSTANCE_ID'])
to monitor the instance and find the best time for instance stop on the main process, and also print the info of the spot price that i have
found in the previous script and if it pass the trash hold using a difrent thread.

the current price is in the SpotPriceHistory in the response and the current price i'm paying is the SpotPrice from the
same response.
