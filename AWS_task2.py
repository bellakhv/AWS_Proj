I didn't had enough time to complete this task due to env issues.

If i had time I would write another script that uses the function ec2.monitor_instances(InstanceIds=['INSTANCE_ID'])
to monitor the instance and find the best time for instance stop, and also print the info of the spot price that i have
found in the previous script and if it pass the trash hold.

the current price is in the SpotPriceHistory in the response and the current price i'm paying is the SpotPrice from the
same response.
